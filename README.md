### CRT Shader aiming to give Minecraft a retro style!
Current features include:

- Imitating Pixels
- Lens Distortion
- Chromatic Aberration and Bleed
- Posterization
- Scan Line

### Customization
While there still are limitied options I aimed to add as much customibitlity as possible giving you the ability to tweak most features to your liking :D

### Warings

This shader should work with Optifine and Iris from 1.8.9 - 1.20.1, if you encounter any issues you can allways report them :D

Also from experience this shader does strain your eyes if you play with it on for hours on end.

The appearance may not be the best in images as it is best experienced in game.

### Installation
- First you need to install either OptiFine or the Iris mod to be able to load shaderpacks. (Choose Iris if you are unsure)
- Then you need to launch the game, and get to the Shaderpacks/Shaders menu in Video Settings.
- Open the shaderpacks folder by clicking the button in the menu.
- Download the CRT Shader and put it in the shaderpacks folder.
- Get back in the game, and choose CRT_Shader in the shaderpacks menu. (Refresh the menu if it doesn't appear)
